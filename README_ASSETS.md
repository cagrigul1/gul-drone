How to add your logo & hero background

Files I created for you:
- assets/.gitkeep                (keeps the folder in git)
- images/.gitkeep                (alternative folder)
- assets/README_ADD_HERO.txt     (instructions and recommended sizes)
- logo.png.placeholder           (please replace with your `logo.png`)

Where to place your files:
- Logo: put `logo.png` in repository root (c:\Users\ggulc\Desktop\GUL.com\logo.png). If you prefer, keep `logo.svg` (already present) — SVG is recommended.
- Hero image: put `assets/hero-bg.jpg` OR `images/hero-bg.jpg`.

After you add the files:
1) Reply here with the word: "hazır"
2) I will commit and push the changes to GitHub and report back when Netlify finishes redeploy.

Tips:
- Optimize images before uploading (TinyPNG, Squoosh). Aim for < 500 KB for faster load.
- If you want me to resize/optimize the image, upload it here and I'll run a simple optimization and replace it for you.
