PLACEHOLDER: Logo file

If you have a raster logo, save it as:

  logo.png

Recommended:
- Prefer SVG (`logo.svg`) for best scaling; if you provide `logo.png`, put it in the project root.
- Recommended size: 500x500 px (transparent background) or an exported high-res PNG.

After you replace this placeholder with your actual `logo.png`, tell me "hazır" and I'll commit & push.
